# customHTMLElement
This repo shows how to create custom HTML elements in plain javascript. This concept underlines the possible implementation of "Components" by front end frameworks.

Caution:
1. Does not work in IE <= 11 versions. These IE's do not support class keywords. Prototypal inheritance can be used instead.
2. Works in Chrome browsers.
3. Still to test for Firefox/Safari/Opera browsers.
